# Zea Gearbox Showcase
This showcase demonstrates how a static CAD model can be brought to life with Zea Kinematics. This example shows how a state machine can be used to change the gear ratio of a gearbox, and to transition between cutaway and exploded views.

Visit the [Zea showcase page](https://blog.zea.live/en/showcase/gearbox) for more information.

## Features
- Change gear ratios in real time
- Explode the model into individual parts
- Switch between illustrated and PBR rendering styles
